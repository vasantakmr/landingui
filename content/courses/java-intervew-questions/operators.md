#### 1) Difference between ‘>>’ and ‘>>>’ operators in java?

'>>' is a right shift operator shifts all of the bits in a value to the right to a specified number of times.

int a =15;
a= a >> 3;

The above line of code moves 15 three characters right.

`> > >` is an unsigned shift operator used to shift right. The places which were vacated by shift are filled 
with zeroes.
