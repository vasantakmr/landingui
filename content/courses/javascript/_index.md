  While working with Zack on preparing the course, he pointed out some stuff in Supabase that I didn’t even know about!
  This course should be <span class="hi">required viewing</span> for anyone building web apps with Supabase; it makes the flow of development to prod then continuing to ship crystal clear!

{{< testimonial name="Paul Copplestone" handle="@kiwicopple" img="paul-copplestone.webp" >}}
  This course is a must for anyone building with Supabase. One of the most comprehensive (and entertaining) tutorials on the web. As a bonus, you’ll <span class="hi">learn a tonne</span> of things about Postgres and SQL that are useful beyond Supabase.
  If you’re shipping a production-ready website or application, this course is 100% recommended

## 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

<div class="box box-blue">
This course is beginner level and expects knowledge on Java for you to be able to answer questions yourself. If you are a fresher, and looking for an entry to corporate world, this course is a must. It is fast-paced, but far more in-depth and with a variety of interview questions.
